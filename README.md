# Cloud-Native Security: From CVE Overload to Risk-Driven Resilience

This repository is a practical guide for navigating the modern vulnerability landscape in OpenShift and Kubernetes environments. It explains why CVE counts are so high, how container security differs from traditional VM patching, and how to move from reactive fixes to a risk-driven, resilient security program using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS).

## Narrative Map

### 1. Traditional VM Security: Where We Started
**Document:** [from-vms-to-containers-lifecycle-evolution-and-security-impact.md](from-vms-to-containers-lifecycle-evolution-and-security-impact.md)  
**Overview:**  
Explains the legacy approach to patching and vulnerability management in virtual machine environments. Highlights the challenges of manual patching, configuration drift, and limited visibility, setting the stage for why a new approach is needed.

### 2. The Container Shift: Why Containers Are Different
**Document:** [the-importance-of-the-base-image.md](the-importance-of-the-base-image.md)  
**Overview:**  
Describes how containers use immutable images and centralized patching. Shows why “zero CVE” images are a myth without disciplined rebuilds, and how increased visibility in container environments surfaces more vulnerabilities than ever before.

### 3. The Way Forward: Risk-Driven Security
**Document:** [from-cve-chaos-to-resilience.md](from-cve-chaos-to-resilience.md)  
**Overview:**  
Outlines a modern, risk-driven approach to vulnerability management using RHACS. Covers actionable strategies for prioritizing remediation, aligning with OpenShift lifecycle, and meeting compliance requirements. Provides an executive summary of RHACS value.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with the legacy pain points** in VM security.
2. **Understand how containers change the game** and why visibility increases.
3. **Adopt a risk-based, automated security approach** with RHACS and OpenShift.
