# Traditional VM Provisioning & Patching Flow

In traditional VM environments, templates are used to provision multiple virtual machines. However, once a VM is created, it becomes **independent** — meaning updates to the template do **not** affect already provisioned machines.

## How to Read the Diagram

### 1. **Template Creation**
Here we have a virtual machine template — created in **January 2025**. It’s the starting point for provisioning new VMs.

### 2. **Provisioning VMs**
Over the next few months, this template is used to provision three virtual machines — one in February, one in March, and one in April.

### 3. **A New CVE Is Discovered**
In May 2025, a new vulnerability (e.g., **CVE-2022-1234**) is discovered. The template is updated with a patch.

### 4. **Future VMs Include the Fix**
VMs provisioned **after** the template is updated include the fix by default.

### 5. **Existing VMs Remain Vulnerable**
The previously provisioned VMs (Feb–Apr) do **not inherit the patch**. They remain vulnerable to the CVE unless manually remediated.

### 6. **Manual Patching Is Required**
To patch these VMs, a tool like **Red Hat Satellite** must be used to manually deliver the updates.

> 🔁 This manual lifecycle creates complexity and risk — especially at scale.

## From VMs to Containers: Lifecycle Evolution and Security Impact

Traditional VM patching, as shown above, creates risk and operational overhead: each VM is independent, and patches must be applied manually to every instance. This model leads to drift, inconsistent security posture, and a heavy maintenance burden at scale.

### How Containers Change the Game

Containers, by design, use an **immutable image model**. Instead of patching running workloads, you update the source image and redeploy. This approach fundamentally changes how vulnerabilities are managed and remediated:

#### 1. **Centralized Base Image Ownership**
- All application images are built from a small set of trusted, curated base images (e.g., UBI, RHEL).
- The platform team is responsible for maintaining and patching these base images.

#### 2. **Automated Patch Propagation**
- When a new CVE is discovered, the base image is updated **once**.
- All downstream application images are rebuilt automatically from the patched base.
- Workloads are redeployed from these rebuilt images — no in-place patching, no manual intervention per workload.

#### 3. **Immutability and Auditability**
- Every image is versioned and signed; deployments are always from a known, trusted source.
- Rollbacks and audits are simple: you know exactly what code and dependencies are running.

#### 4. **No More Configuration Drift**
- Since containers are replaced, not patched in place, there is no risk of VMs drifting out of compliance or missing patches.

#### 5. **Speed and Scale**
- Remediation is fast: fix the base, rebuild, redeploy — and every workload is protected.
- This enables true DevSecOps and GitOps workflows, where security is embedded in the pipeline and enforced automatically.

### Detailed Comparison: VM vs. Container Patch Lifecycle

| Aspect                | Traditional VM                        | Container Workflow (Base Image Model)      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Patch Propagation     | Manual, per-VM                        | Automated, via base image rebuild          |
| Drift Risk            | High (each VM drifts over time)       | Low (images are immutable, always replaced)|
| Auditability          | Complex, requires tracking per VM     | Simple, image history and provenance       |
| Speed of Remediation  | Slow, operationally intensive         | Fast, scalable, automated                  |
| Consistency           | Inconsistent, depends on manual work  | Consistent, enforced by pipeline           |
| Security Ownership    | Fragmented, per-VM responsibility     | Centralized at image and pipeline level    |
| Rollback              | Difficult, may require snapshots      | Easy, just redeploy previous image         |

> **Key Takeaway:**  
> With containers, you move from reactive, manual patching to proactive, automated remediation.  
> Fix the base image, rebuild, redeploy — and every workload is protected.  
> This is the foundation for scalable, resilient security in modern environments.
